::: {.theorem}
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

::: {.corollary data-credit=我呀 .fragment}
Here's some math:
$$
\phi_n(\kappa) = 
 \frac{1}{4\pi^2\kappa^2} \int_0^\infty
 \frac{\sin(\kappa R)}{\kappa R}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial R}
 \left[R^2\frac{\partial D_n(R)}{\partial R}\right]\,dR
$$

# Conclusion

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$
